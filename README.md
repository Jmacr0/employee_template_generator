# Template Engine - Employee Summary

 In this homework assignment, I built a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, I will also be ensuring that all unit tests pass.

### User Story
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```
To run the application, enter in the terminal: 
```
node index.js
```
